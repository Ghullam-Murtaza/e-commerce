######################### Auto Reload or Hot Reload not working in Gitpod by default #########################;
(article link: https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11897)

>>> Solution: Copy the following Code to 'node_modules/react-scripts/config/webpackDevServer.config.js' inside the

######################### Bootstrap 'content going outside its box #########################;
>>> give the 'Row' that exist inside any component other than 'Non-Fluid Container', a 'margin' auto or zero because the
    'Row' component has default 'negative margin' set on it probably to counter the 'padding' applied by the 'Non-Fluid
    Container'. and 'Col' has 'padding' applied on to counter that 'negative margin' of 'Row'.
  So when you see your 'content' going outside its content-box then make sure to see if that 'element' or its
  'parent' is applying any 'negative margins or paddings'.
  Normally, you should set 'margin-zero' on 'Row' and 'padding-zero' on 'Col' and then set the desired 'padding' on the
  'Non-Fluid Container' (like in the axil-bar, I have set the horizontal 'padding' of '8px' on 'Non-Fluid Container' that
  was by default '-12px').
